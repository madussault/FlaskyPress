    Attributes
    ----------
    TESTING : bool
        Enable testing mode. Exceptions are propagated rather than handled by
        the appâ€™s error handlers.

        Must be set to True to prevent the mail logger from sending email
        warnings.
    LOGIN_DISABLED : bool
        When set to True the /routes protected by Flask-login become
        accessible without having to log into the app.
    WHOOSHEE_MEMORY_STORAGE : bool
        When set to True use the memory as storage. We need that during our
        tests so the data that we write in the in-memory SQLite database do
        not become indexed.
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI : str
        Make SQLAlchemy to use an in-memory SQLite database during the tests,
        so this way we are not writing dummy test data to our production
        database.
    WTF_CSRF_ENABLED : bool
        When set to False all CSRF protection are disabled. We have to
        disable that because no CSRF token are generated when executing a POST
        request directly in our test.
